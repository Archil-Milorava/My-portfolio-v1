            <p className=" h-full w-full text-start pt-16 leading-8">Hello! I&apos;m a passionate web developer with a strong foundation in modern front-end technologies, including React, Redux Toolkit, and Tailwind CSS. I enjoy creating responsive, dynamic web applications that offer seamless user experiences. While I don&apos;t have formal work experience in the tech field, I&apos;ve honed my skills through personal projects and continuous learning. I&apos;m well-versed in interacting with backend services, which allows me to build full-featured applications from the ground up. I&apos;m eager to contribute to innovative projects and collaborate with teams that are as enthusiastic about tech as I am.
